      <h2>Introduction to Next.js</h2>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of <em>de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</em> (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, <strong>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."</strong>, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
      <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from <em>de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</em> by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
      <h3>Why Next.js?</h3>
      <p>Next.js is a powerful React framework that simplifies server-side rendering, static site generation, and API creation. Its file-based routing and built-in optimizations make it a favorite for modern web development. Developers can create fast, SEO-friendly applications with minimal configuration.</p>
      <p>With features like automatic code splitting, TypeScript support, and a rich ecosystem of plugins, Next.js empowers developers to build scalable applications. Whether you're creating a blog, e-commerce platform, or dashboard, Next.js provides the tools to streamline development and enhance performance.</p>
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>To start with Next.js, you can use <code>npx create-next-app</code> to scaffold a new project. This sets up a basic structure with pages, styles, and a development server. From there, you can create dynamic routes, fetch data with <code>getStaticProps</code> or <code>getServerSideProps</code>, and deploy to platforms like Vercel.</p>
      <p>Next.js also supports incremental static regeneration, allowing you to update static content without rebuilding the entire site. This is ideal for large-scale applications with frequently changing data.</p>

    content: `
      <h2>Mastering React Hooks</h2>
      <p>React Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, revolutionized how developers manage state and side effects in functional components. Unlike class components, Hooks allow you to write reusable, composable logic without complex lifecycle methods.</p>
      <p>The most common Hooks, <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>, simplify state management and side effects like data fetching or DOM manipulation. For example, <code>useState</code> lets you add state to functional components, while <code>useEffect</code> handles side effects like API calls or subscriptions.</p>
      <h3>Custom Hooks</h3>
      <p>Custom Hooks let you extract reusable logic into separate functions. Imagine a <code>useFetch</code> Hook that handles API requests, error handling, and loading states. By abstracting this logic, you can reuse it across components without duplication.</p>
      <p>Here’s a sample custom Hook:</p>
      <pre><code>function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => {
        setData(data);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, [url]);
  return { data, loading };
}</code></pre>
      <p>This Hook can be used in any component to fetch data, making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable. React Hooks also integrate seamlessly with libraries like React Query for advanced data fetching or Redux for state management.</p>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <p>When using Hooks, follow these rules: only call Hooks at the top level of your function (not inside loops or conditions), and only use them in React function components or custom Hooks. These rules ensure predictable behavior and avoid bugs.</p>
      <p>Hooks have transformed React development, enabling cleaner, more modular code. Whether you're building a small app or a complex enterprise solution, mastering Hooks is essential for modern React development.</p>

    content: `
      <h2>TypeScript: Powering Robust JavaScript</h2>
      <p>TypeScript brings static typing to JavaScript, catching errors during development rather than at runtime. By adding type annotations, you can define the shape of objects, functions, and variables, making your code more predictable and easier to debug.</p>
      <p>For example, consider a function that calculates a user’s age:</p>
      <pre><code>interface User {
  name: string;
  birthYear: number;
}
function getAge(user: User): number {
  return new Date().getFullYear() - user.birthYear;
}</code></pre>
      <p>Here, TypeScript ensures that <code>user</code> has the required properties and that <code>birthYear</code> is a number, preventing runtime errors.</p>
      <h3>Scaling with TypeScript</h3>
      <p>In large applications, TypeScript shines by providing type safety across components, APIs, and libraries. Features like interfaces, generics, and union types allow you to model complex data structures with precision.</p>
      <p>TypeScript also improves developer experience with better IDE support, offering autocompletion, refactoring tools, and inline error checking. This reduces bugs and speeds up development, especially in teams where multiple developers work on the same codebase.</p>
      <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
      <p>TypeScript is widely used in projects like Angular, Vue 3, and NestJS. It’s also a popular choice for React developers who want type-safe components. By integrating TypeScript with tools like ESLint and Prettier, you can enforce consistent code quality across your project.</p>
      <p>Adopting TypeScript may have a learning curve, but the benefits—fewer bugs, better scalability, and improved collaboration—make it a must-have for modern JavaScript development.</p>

    content: `
      <h2>Building Layouts with CSS Grid</h2>
      <p>CSS Grid is a game-changer for web layouts, offering a two-dimensional system for creating complex, responsive designs. Unlike Flexbox, which is one-dimensional, Grid lets you control rows and columns simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Here’s a simple example of a dashboard layout:</p>
      <pre><code>.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  gap: 10px;
}
.header { grid-area: header; }
.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
.main { grid-area: main; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }</code></pre>
      <p>This creates a responsive layout with a header, sidebar, main content, and footer, all aligned perfectly with minimal code.</p>
      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <p>CSS Grid’s <code>auto-fit</code> and <code>minmax</code> functions make responsive layouts effortless. For example:</p>
      <pre><code>.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 15px;
}</code></pre>
      <p>This creates a gallery where items adjust dynamically based on screen size, ensuring a clean layout on any device.</p>
      <h3>Combining with Flexbox</h3>
      <p>Grid and Flexbox complement each other. Use Grid for overall layout and Flexbox for aligning items within a grid cell. This combination gives you unparalleled control over your UI.</p>
      <p>By mastering CSS Grid, you can create layouts that are both visually stunning and highly functional, all while keeping your CSS concise and maintainable.</p>

    content: `
      <h2>Building APIs with Node.js</h2>
      <p>Node.js is a lightweight, event-driven runtime that excels at building scalable APIs. Its non-blocking I/O model handles high concurrency, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat apps or live dashboards.</p>
      <p>Here’s a basic Express API setup:</p>
      <pre><code>const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json([{ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }]);
});
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));</code></pre>
      <p>This creates a simple API endpoint to fetch users. Express middleware can handle tasks like authentication, logging, or error handling.</p>
      <h3>Scaling with Clustering</h3>
      <p>Node.js runs on a single thread, but you can use the <code>cluster</code> module to leverage multi-core systems:</p>
      <pre><code>const cluster = require('cluster');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;
if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  const app = require('express')();
  app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello!'));
  app.listen(3000);
}</code></pre>
      <p>This distributes requests across multiple processes, improving performance under heavy loads.</p>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <p>Use environment variables for configuration, implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, and add error handling middleware to ensure robust APIs. Tools like PM2 can further enhance production deployments with monitoring and auto-restarts.</p>

    image: "https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300",
    content: `
      <h2>GraphQL: A Modern API Approach</h2>
      <p>GraphQL offers a flexible alternative to REST, allowing clients to request only the data they need. This eliminates over-fetching (getting too much data) and under-fetching (missing required data) common in REST APIs.</p>
      <p>Here’s a simple GraphQL schema:</p>
      <pre><code>type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
}
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}</code></pre>
      <p>With GraphQL, a client can request exactly what they need, like <code>{ user(id: "1") { name } }</code>, and get only the user’s name.</p>
      <h3>Setting Up a GraphQL Server</h3>
      <p>Using Apollo Server, you can set up a GraphQL API quickly:</p>
      <pre><code>const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const typeDefs = gql\`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
\`;
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello, GraphQL!'
  }
};
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen().then(({ url }) => console.log(\`Server ready at \${url}\`));</code></pre>
      <p>This creates a basic GraphQL server with a single query.</p>
      <h3>GraphQL vs REST</h3>
      <p>REST requires multiple endpoints for different resources, while GraphQL uses a single endpoint with a flexible query language. However, GraphQL can be complex to implement, especially for caching and versioning. Choose GraphQL for dynamic, data-driven apps and REST for simpler, resource-based APIs.</p>

      <h2>Why Choose Vue.js?</h2>
      <p>Vue.js is a progressive framework that balances simplicity and power. Its reactive data binding and component-based architecture make it easy to build interactive UIs, from small widgets to large-scale applications.</p>
      <p>Here’s a simple Vue component:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;button @click="updateMessage"&gt;Update&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  data() {
    return { message: 'Hello, Vue!' };
  },
  methods: {
    updateMessage() {
      this.message = 'Updated!';
    }
  }
};
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>This component displays a message and updates it when a button is clicked.</p>
      <h3>Vue’s Ecosystem</h3>
      <p>Vue offers tools like Vuex for state management and Vue Router for navigation. The Composition API, introduced in Vue 3, provides a flexible way to organize code, similar to React Hooks.</p>
      <p>For example, the Composition API version of the above component:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;button @click="updateMessage"&gt;Update&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
import { ref } from 'vue';
export default {
  setup() {
    const message = ref('Hello, Vue!');
    const updateMessage = () => {
      message.value = 'Updated!';
    };
    return { message, updateMessage };
  }
};
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>Vue’s simplicity and robust ecosystem make it a great choice for developers of all skill levels.</p>

      <h2>Containerizing with Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker simplifies application deployment by packaging code and dependencies into containers. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.</p>
      <p>Here’s a Dockerfile for a Node.js app:</p>
      <pre><code>FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]</code></pre>
      <p>This Dockerfile sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs the app.</p>
      <h3>Using Docker Compose</h3>
      <p>For multi-container apps, Docker Compose simplifies configuration:</p>
      <pre><code>version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"</code></pre>
      <p>This defines a Node.js app and a MongoDB database, linked together.</p>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <p>Minimize image size by using multi-stage builds, avoid running containers as root, and use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files. Docker’s portability and scalability make it essential for modern development workflows.</p>
